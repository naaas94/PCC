## Introduction

This document outlines the immediate next steps for the Privacy Case Classifier (PCC) system. The plan is structured in two phases: (1) productionizing the current PCC pipeline with robust inference and monitoring endpoints, and (2) developing a parallel synthetic data generation and ingestion pipeline. The goal is to enhance observability, resilience, and experimentation capacity, while maintaining compliance and operational excellence.

## Phase 1: Production-Ready Inference & Monitoring Endpoints

### Objectives
- Expose two robust endpoints:
  - **Inference Endpoint:** For real-time or batch classification of customer support cases.
  - **Monitoring Endpoint:** For logging, drift detection, diagnostics, and audit trails.
- Integrate with Looker for visualization and operational monitoring over a rolling 7-day window.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Endpoint Design & Deployment**
   - Define clear API contracts for inference and monitoring endpoints (input/output schemas, error handling, metadata).
   - Deploy endpoints in a scalable, secure environment (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure).
2. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Route all inference requests through the inference endpoint.
   - Log all predictions, metadata, and errors to the monitoring endpoint.
3. **Looker Integration**
   - Connect monitoring endpoint outputs to Looker dashboards.
   - Build visualizations for key metrics: volume, confidence, drift, error rates, and operational health.
4. **Alerting & Automation**
   - Set up automated alerts for drift, anomalies, or low-confidence predictions.
   - Document operational runbooks for incident response.

### Expected Outcomes
- Transparent, auditable, and production-grade inference pipeline.
- Real-time and historical monitoring of model performance and operational health.
- Rapid feedback loops for model and data issues.
- Foundation for scalable experimentation and compliance.

## Phase 2: Synthetic Data Generation & Parallel Ingestion Pipeline

### Objectives
- Develop a parallel pipeline to generate synthetic customer support conversations using a free LLM.
- Store generated conversations in a dedicated endpoint.
- Ingest synthetic data into the PCC pipeline for embedding, validation, inference, and logging.
- Use synthetic data for stress-testing, drift monitoring, and experimentation.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Select and configure a free LLM for generating realistic CS conversations.
   - Define templates or prompts to ensure diversity and coverage of privacy intents.
   - Automate daily generation of synthetic conversations (volume and diversity targets).
2. **Synthetic Data Storage**
   - Design a dedicated endpoint for storing generated conversations (with clear separation from real data).
   - Implement versioning and metadata tracking for traceability.
3. **PCC Pipeline Integration**
   - Ingest synthetic conversations into the PCC pipeline.
   - Generate embeddings, validate input, run inference, and log results as with real data.
   - Clearly tag and separate synthetic data in all logs and outputs.
4. **Monitoring & Evaluation**
   - Extend Looker dashboards to include synthetic data metrics.
   - Periodically review synthetic data quality and relevance.
   - Optionally, inject known intents for pseudo-ground truth evaluation.

### Expected Outcomes
- Safe, scalable environment for pipeline stress-testing and drift detection.
- Continuous validation of PCC performance on both real and synthetic data.
- Ability to simulate rare, edge, or adversarial cases for robust monitoring.
- Enhanced experimentation capacity without impacting production data.

## Considerations & Recommendations
- **Data Separation:** Maintain strict separation and clear labeling of real vs. synthetic data at all stages.
- **Quality Assurance:** Periodically review synthetic data for realism and utility; adjust generation logic as needed.
- **Compliance & Ethics:** Clearly communicate the use of synthetic data in all monitoring and reporting tools.
- **Scalability:** Design endpoints and pipelines for easy scaling as data volume and use cases grow.
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for all endpoints, schemas, and operational procedures.

## Summary

This plan provides a pragmatic, modular path to enhance the PCC system’s observability, resilience, and experimental agility. By productionizing inference and monitoring, and layering in synthetic data generation, the system will be well-positioned for robust, transparent, and scalable ML operations.
