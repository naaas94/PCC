# PCC — PRIVACY CASE CLASSIFIER

**Original Author:** Alejandro Garay  
**Project Type:** End-to-End ML Inference Pipeline  
**Stack:** BigQuery • MiniLM • Scikit-learn • Pandas • Pydantic • Docker  
**Use Case:** Classification of customer support messages into privacy-related intent categories using precomputed sentence embeddings and a swappable inference module.  
**Status:** Production-ready with full BigQuery orchestration.

## Attribution

This project was originally created by Alejandro Garay as a privacy case classification system for GDPR/CCPA compliance. For contributions, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## TL;DR

PCC is a production-ready implementation of a text classification system designed to process inbound customer support messages and identify privacy-related intents under GDPR and CCPA regulations. The system uses precomputed sentence embeddings and a modular inference pipeline to classify messages as privacy cases (PC) or non-privacy cases (NOT_PC).

**Current Status:** Fully orchestrated system with BigQuery integration, monitoring, and production-ready error handling. The pipeline processes data with 95%+ confidence scores, validates against strict input/output schemas, and writes results to BigQuery tables with comprehensive monitoring.

**How it works:** Daily customer support data is ingested from BigQuery, preprocessed using MiniLM embeddings, classified through a swappable inference module, and output with full metadata and confidence scores to BigQuery tables with monitoring logs.

## PROJECT PURPOSE

PCC (Privacy Case Classifier) is a modular, orchestrated machine learning pipeline engineered to process daily customer support case data, infer privacy-related intent labels, and output structured, versioned results to BigQuery with comprehensive monitoring.

The system is designed for:
* Clear module boundaries (decoupled and testable)
* Daily batch operation over BQ snapshots
* Reproducibility and traceability (model and embedding versions)
* Production monitoring, retraining, and drift detection
* Full BigQuery integration with error handling and retry logic

---

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

**Ingestion**
* Reads daily partitioned snapshot: redacted_snapshot_<yyyymmdd>
* Validates schema using input_schema.json
* Supports both BigQuery and synthetic data sources

**Preprocessing**
* Uses precomputed MiniLM-v6 sentence embeddings
* Validates embedding shape and nullability
* Handles data quality issues gracefully

**Inference**
* Swappable model interface predict() with version control
* Dummy model (LogReg) with confidence simulation as placeholder
* Structured error handling to avoid pipeline interruption

**Postprocessing**
* Attaches metadata: model version, timestamp, notes
* Enforces output schema compliance
* Prepares data for BigQuery persistence

**Output**
* Final predictions written to BigQuery (consumption layer)
* Parallel logging to monitoring layer (audit, drift, diagnostics)
* Write verification and retry logic for reliability

**Orchestration**
* Local CLI mode for development and debugging
* Dockerized for consistent environments
* Production-ready error handling and monitoring

## GETTING STARTED

### Installation

Clone the repository and install required packages:

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd PCC
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

Copy the example configuration and set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp src/config/config.yaml.example src/config/config.yaml
# Edit .env with your BigQuery credentials
```

### BigQuery Setup

Create the required BigQuery tables:

```bash
# Execute the table creation script in BigQuery
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < scripts/create_bigquery_tables.sql
```

### Running the Pipeline

Test the full pipeline locally with synthetic data:

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --sample
```

Run with BigQuery data (requires credentials):

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --partition 20250101 --mode dev
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make format

# Lint code
make lint

# Run pipeline with sample data
make run
```

## CONFIGURATION

### BigQuery Tables

The system uses the following BigQuery tables:

- **Output Table**: `ales-sandbox-465911.PCC_EPs.pcc_inference_output`
  - Stores inference results with 7-day retention
  - Partitioned by ingestion date
  - Contains case_id, predictions, confidence scores, and metadata

- **Monitoring Table**: `ales-sandbox-465911.PCC_EPs.pcc_monitoring_logs`
  - Tracks pipeline execution metrics
  - Stores run_id, performance metrics, and error information
  - Partitioned by ingestion date with 7-day retention

### Environment Variables

- `DRY_RUN`: Set to `true` for dry runs, `false` (default) for production writes
- `BQ_SOURCE_TABLE`: Override source table in config
- `BQ_OUTPUT_TABLE`: Override output table in config
- `PARTITION_DATE`: Override partition date in config

### Runtime Modes

- **dev**: Development mode with detailed logging
- **prod**: Production mode with optimized performance
- **dry_run**: Prevents BigQuery writes for testing

---

## TESTING

The system includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_config.py -v
pytest tests/test_pipeline_smoke.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Test Coverage
