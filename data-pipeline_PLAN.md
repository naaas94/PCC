# Data Pipeline: Action Plan

**Project Type:** Modular Data Engineering & Curation Pipeline  
**Stack:** Python • Pandas • Great Expectations (optional)  
**Purpose:** Automated, auditable generation of high-quality, curated training datasets for privacy intent classification, ready for downstream ML pipelines.

---

## Overview

This project implements a robust, production-aligned data pipeline for the synthesis, validation, and curation of training datasets for privacy intent classification. The pipeline is designed to simulate or process raw data, enforce data quality standards, perform stratified sampling and balancing, and export reproducible datasets for model development in the PCC ecosystem.

## Action Plan

### 1. Project Structure

```
data-pipeline/
├── src/
│   ├── data_pipeline.py          # Main ETL and curation script
│   ├── validators/               # Schema and data quality checks
│   └── utils/                    # Shared utilities (logger, sampling, etc.)
├── output/                       # Curated datasets (CSV/Parquet)
├── requirements.txt              # Dependencies
├── README.md                     # Documentation
└── ...
```

### 2. Data Synthesis or Ingestion
- Simulate labeled datasets and control groups if real data is unavailable.
- Ingest raw or semi-structured data from local or cloud sources as needed.
- Document all assumptions and simulation parameters for transparency.

### 3. ETL & Data Validation
- Apply rigorous schema validation (column types, shapes, nulls, outliers).
- Integrate Great Expectations or custom validators for data quality enforcement.
- Log all validation steps and outcomes for auditability.

### 4. Stratified Sampling & Grouping
- Implement stratified sampling to ensure representative class and feature distributions.
- Automate creation of control groups and test splits as required.
- Support flexible sampling strategies (by intent, channel, semantic density, etc.).

### 5. Class Balancing & Enrichment
- Apply automated class balancing (e.g., SMOTE, oversampling, undersampling) as needed.
- Enrich datasets with synthetic features or metadata if required for downstream tasks.
- Ensure all transformations are logged and reproducible.

### 6. Export & Integration
- Export curated datasets to `/output/curated_training_data.csv` or `.parquet`.
- Provide clear instructions for transferring datasets to the model-training-pipeline (`/data/`).
- (Optional) Support export to cloud storage or data warehouses (e.g., BigQuery) for enterprise integration.

### 7. Documentation & Reproducibility
- Maintain a professional `README.md` with:
  - Project purpose and architecture
  - Usage instructions and configuration
  - Integration points with model-training-pipeline and PCC
  - Example commands and expected outputs
- Document all simulation, validation, and curation logic for full traceability.

### 8. Testing & Data Quality Assurance
- Implement unit and integration tests for core ETL and validation logic.
- Validate end-to-end reproducibility with sample runs.
- Ensure compatibility with evolving schema and downstream ML requirements.

## Integration with PCC Ecosystem

- **Output:** Curated, validated training dataset for model-training-pipeline (`/output/curated_training_data.csv` or `.parquet`).
- **Traceability:** All data generation, validation, and curation steps are logged and versioned.
- **Reproducibility:** Datasets can be regenerated on demand with identical results given the same parameters.

---

## Design Principles

- **Data Quality:** Enforce strict validation and curation at every stage.
- **Reproducibility:** Deterministic outputs, versioned logic and parameters.
- **Auditability:** Transparent logging and documentation of all steps.
- **Modularity:** Decoupled ETL, validation, and export components for easy extension.
- **Production-Readiness:** Outputs and logs suitable for real-world ML engineering workflows.

*This plan reflects a sober, professional approach to data engineering and ML curation, emphasizing clarity, traceability, and production alignment. All documentation and code should maintain this standard throughout the project lifecycle.*
