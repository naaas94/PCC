# Model Training Pipeline: Action Plan

**Project Type:** Modular ML Model Training Pipeline  
**Stack:** Python • Scikit-learn • Pandas • MLflow (optional)  
**Purpose:** Reproducible, auditable, and scalable training of privacy intent classification models for integration with the PCC system.

---

## Overview

This project implements a robust, production-oriented pipeline for training and versioning ML models for privacy intent classification. The pipeline is designed to consume curated datasets generated by the data-pipeline, perform systematic training, evaluation, and artifact management, and output versioned models ready for deployment in the PCC inference layer.

## Action Plan

### 1. Project Structure

```
model-training-pipeline/
├── src/
│   ├── train_pipeline.py         # Main training script
│   ├── utils/                   # Shared utilities (logger, metrics, etc.)
│   └── models/                  # Trained model artifacts
├── data/                        # Curated training datasets (CSV/Parquet)
├── notebooks/                   # (Optional) EDA and analysis
├── requirements.txt             # Dependencies
├── README.md                    # Documentation
└── ...
```

### 2. Data Ingestion
- Ingest curated training data from `/data/curated_training_data.csv` or `.parquet`.
- Validate schema, feature types, and class distribution.
- Log dataset version and provenance for traceability.

### 3. Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, outliers, and feature normalization as required.
- Support flexible feature selection (e.g., embeddings, metadata).
- Ensure compatibility with downstream inference requirements.

### 4. Model Training
- Implement reproducible training of a baseline classifier (e.g., LogisticRegression).
- Support hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, cross-validation).
- Track training metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC) and log results.
- (Optional) Integrate MLflow for experiment tracking and artifact management.

### 5. Evaluation
- Evaluate model on a hold-out test set (stratified split).
- Generate and persist evaluation reports (classification report, confusion matrix, ROC/PR curves).
- Document model performance and limitations.

### 6. Model Persistence
- Serialize and version trained models (`.pkl` or `.joblib`) in `/src/models/`.
- Store accompanying metadata (training date, data version, hyperparameters, metrics).
- Ensure artifacts are ready for seamless integration with the PCC inference layer.

### 7. Documentation & Reproducibility
- Provide a clear, professional `README.md` with:
  - Project purpose and architecture
  - Usage instructions (CLI, config)
  - Integration points with data-pipeline and PCC
  - Example commands and expected outputs
- Document all assumptions, limitations, and manual steps (if any).

### 8. Testing & Validation
- Implement unit and smoke tests for core training logic.
- Validate end-to-end reproducibility with sample datasets.
- Ensure compatibility with evolving data schemas and PCC requirements.

## Integration with PCC Ecosystem

- **Input:** Curated training dataset from data-pipeline (`/data/curated_training_data.csv` or `.parquet`).
- **Output:** Versioned model artifact and metadata for deployment in PCC.
- **Traceability:** All training runs are logged with data and parameter provenance.

---

## Design Principles

- **Reproducibility:** Deterministic training, versioned data and models.
- **Auditability:** Transparent logging of all steps and metrics.
- **Modularity:** Decoupled components for easy extension and maintenance.
- **Production-Readiness:** Artifacts and reports suitable for real-world deployment and monitoring.
