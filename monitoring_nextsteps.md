# ML Monitoring Next Steps

Alright, so we've got this intent classification pipeline running, but let's be real - we need proper monitoring to know what the hell is actually happening in production. Here's what we should implement to get from "it works on my machine" to "we actually know what's going on."

## Core Metrics We Need to Track

### Model Performance Metrics
- **Prediction Quality**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
- **Model Drift**: PSI (Population Stability Index), KL divergence, prediction distribution shifts
- **Feature Drift**: Statistical tests on input feature distributions over time
- **Model Decay**: Performance degradation over time, retraining triggers

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Schema Validation**: Missing values, data type mismatches, range violations
- **Completeness**: Null/empty value rates, feature coverage
- **Consistency**: Duplicate detection, format validation
- **Freshness**: Data staleness, pipeline lag times
- **Distribution Shifts**: Statistical tests (KS test, chi-square) on feature distributions

### Inference Metrics
- **Latency**: P50, P95, P99 response times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second, batch processing rates
- **Error Rates**: 4xx/5xx HTTP errors, model prediction failures
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, GPU usage
- **Queue Metrics**: Queue depth, processing times

### Business Metrics
- **Intent Distribution**: Counts by predicted intent, confidence scores
- **User Behavior**: Request patterns, peak usage times
- **Cost Metrics**: Inference costs, resource consumption
- **SLA Compliance**: Uptime, response time SLAs

## Aggregation Strategy

### Time-based Aggregations
- **Real-time**: 1-minute windows for alerting
- **Short-term**: 5-15 minute windows for dashboards
- **Daily**: Hourly aggregations for trend analysis
- **Weekly/Monthly**: For long-term model performance tracking

### Dimensional Aggregations
- By model version, environment, user segment, feature groups
- Geographic/regional breakdowns if applicable
- A/B testing cohorts

## Technology Stack

### Metrics Collection & Storage
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: For real-time metrics, alerting, and dashboards
- **InfluxDB**: For time-series data with high cardinality
- **BigQuery**: For historical analysis and ML-specific metrics

### Data Quality & Validation
- **Great Expectations**: For data quality checks and validation
- **Apache Airflow**: For pipeline orchestration and monitoring
- **Deequ (AWS)**: For data quality at scale

### Model Monitoring
- **MLflow**: For model versioning and performance tracking
- **Weights & Biases**: For experiment tracking and model monitoring
- **Evidently AI**: For model drift detection
- **Arize AI**: For comprehensive ML observability

### Logging & Tracing
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For log aggregation
- **Jaeger/Zipkin**: For distributed tracing
- **OpenTelemetry**: For unified observability

## Intent-Specific Metrics for Our Pipeline

### Intent Distribution Tracking
```python
# Example metrics to track
intent_counts = Counter('intent_predictions_total', ['intent', 'confidence_bucket'])
intent_confidence = Histogram('intent_confidence_score', buckets=[0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9])
prediction_latency = Histogram('prediction_duration_seconds', buckets=[0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0])
```

### Data Quality Checks
- Input text length distributions
- Language detection consistency
- Embedding quality metrics
- Schema validation pass rates

### Model Performance Tracking
- Intent classification accuracy by confidence threshold
- Confusion matrix updates
- Feature importance drift
- Embedding space drift detection

## A/B Testing Strategy

### Inference Pipeline A/B Testing
- **Model Version A/B Testing**: Compare new model vs. current model in production
- **Feature Flag A/B Testing**: Test different preprocessing approaches, confidence thresholds
- **Traffic Splitting**: Route percentage of traffic to different model versions
- **Business Impact Testing**: Measure user satisfaction, conversion rates, business KPIs

### Training Pipeline A/B Testing
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Test different model architectures, hyperparameters
- **Feature Engineering**: Compare feature sets, embedding methods
- **Training Strategy**: Different data augmentation, validation strategies
- **Offline Evaluation**: Cross-validation, holdout set performance

## Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts (Immediate response)
- Model accuracy drops below threshold
- High error rates (>5%)
- Data quality violations
- Service downtime

### Warning Alerts (Investigate within hours)
- Latency degradation
- Model drift detection
- Unusual intent distribution patterns
- Resource utilization spikes

### Info Alerts (Daily review)
- Model performance trends
- Data quality reports
- Cost optimization opportunities

## Monitoring vs Training Pipeline Separation

### Inference Pipeline Monitoring (Real-time, Production-focused)

- Data Quality (Production Data)
- Operational Metrics
- Business Metrics

### Training Pipeline Monitoring (Batch, Development-focused)
- Training Performance
- Data Quality (Training Data)
- Model Development Metrics
- Offline Evaluation

1. **`src/monitoring/metrics_collector.py`** - Core metrics collection
2. **`src/monitoring/drift_detector.py`** - Model and data drift detection
3. **`src/monitoring/alerting.py`** - Alerting logic and notifications
4. **`src/monitoring/ab_testing.py`** - A/B testing framework
5. **`docker-compose.monitoring.yml`** - Monitoring stack deployment
6. **`k8s/monitoring/`** - Kubernetes monitoring manifests

4. **Implement alerting** for critical issues
5. **Gradually add** more sophisticated monitoring as needed

Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Start with the basics and iterate. We need to know what's happening before we can optimize it.
